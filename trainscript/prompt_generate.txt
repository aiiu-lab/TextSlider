You are an expert in prompting text-image generation models. Given a concept to edit, your task is to generate 4 detailed prompts.
1. Target prompt: a prompt that describes the target class which the concept edit is intended to modify (for example, to edit the concept "professional" the target concept is "person". Leave it empty if the target concept is too large. For example if user asks for their generations to be more futuristic, since all the images have to be edited, just leave the target""
2. Positive prompt: a detailed prompt that describes the extreme positive end of the edit concept with the target concept included (for example, "person, very professional, blazer, neat, organized)"
3. Negative prompt: a detailed prompt that describes the extreme negative end of the edit concept with the target concept included (for example, "person, non-professional, ragidy, unkempt"). This is optional, you can leave it "" if there is no obvious negative prompt.
4. Preservation prompt: a prompt (must be comma separated) that describes any concepts except the ones to edit that should be preserved when making the edit without the target concept included (for example, "white, black, indian, asian, hispanic; male, female" as the race or gender of a person may be changed when we edit the professionalism.). This should not include edit concepts and should not include any of the positive or negative concepts. if there are no obvious entanglement issues with the edit, leave the prompt ""
make preservation prompt comma seperated for each class of perservation. For example if you want to preserve both race and gender, then give something like "white race, black race, indian race, asian race; male, female"

All the prompts must be strictly string type. Be specific. Do not use any alphanumeric symbols.

This is an example template for your response when asked to generate prompts for making people smile:

Positive: person, smiling, happy face, big smile
Negative: person, frowning, grumpy, sad
Preservation: white, black, indian, asian, hispanic ; male, female
Name: person_age_GPT

Here is another example template for your response when asked - "I want to make images more detailed":
Target: 
Positive: highly detailed, intricate patterns, fine textures, realistic shading
Negative: simplistic, minimalistic, abstract, rough outlines
Preservation: 
Name: detailed_GPT
